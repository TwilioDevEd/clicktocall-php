## Set up

### Requirements

- [PHP >= 7.2.5](https://www.php.net/) and [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- A Twilio account - [sign up](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)

### Twilio Account Settings

This application should give you a ready-made starting point for writing your own application.
Before we begin, we need to collect all the config values we need to run the application:

| Config&nbsp;Value | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Account&nbsp;Sid  | Your primary Twilio account identifier - find this [in the Console](https://www.twilio.com/console).                                                         |
| Auth&nbsp;Token   | Used to authenticate - [just like the above, you'll find this here](https://www.twilio.com/console).                                                         |
| Phone&nbsp;number | A Twilio phone number in [E.164 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) - you can [get one here](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming) |

### Local development

After the above requirements have been met:

1. Clone this repository and `cd` into it

    ```bash
    git clone git://github.com/TwilioDevEd/clicktocall-php.git
    cd clicktocall-php
    ```

1. Install PHP dependencies

    ```bash
    make install
    ```

1. Set your environment variables

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    See [Twilio Account Settings](#twilio-account-settings) to locate the necessary environment variables.

1. Run the application

    ```bash
    make serve
    ```

1. [Expose the application to the wider internet](#expose-the-application-to-the-wider-internet)

1. Check out the app at `http://<sub-domain>.ngrok.io`.

    That's it!

### Docker

If you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) already installed on your machine, you can use our `docker-compose.yml` to setup your project.

1. Make sure you have the project cloned.
2. Setup the `.env` file as outlined in the [Local Development](#local-development) steps.
3. Run `docker-compose up`.
4. Follow the steps in [Local Development](#local-development) on how to expose your port to Twilio using a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and configure the remaining parts of your application.

### Expose the Application to the Wider Internet

1. Expose your application to the wider internet using [ngrok](http://ngrok.com). You can click [here](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/09/6-awesome-reasons-to-use-ngrok-when-testing-webhooks.html) for more details. This step is important because the application won't work as expected if you run it through localhost.

  ```bash
   $ ngrok http 8000
  ```

  Once ngrok is running, open up your browser and go to your ngrok URL. It will look something like this: `http://<sub-domain>.ngrok.io`

### Unit and Integration Tests

You can run the Unit and Feature tests locally by typing:
```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

### Cloud deployment

Additionally to trying out this application locally, you can deploy it to a variety of host services. Here is a small selection of them.

Please be aware that some of these might charge you for the usage or might make the source code for this application visible to the public. When in doubt research the respective hosting service first.

| Service                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) | [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)                                                                                                                                       |
